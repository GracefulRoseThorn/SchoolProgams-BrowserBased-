			 <p>The state police SWAT officer who investigators say fired five times at refuge occupation spokesman Robert "LaVoy"
			 Finicum said Monday he second-guessed himself when he learned of an unaccounted-for bullet hole in the roof of 
			 Finicum's truck.</p>
			 <p>
			 In the days after the Jan. 26, 2016, shooting in Harney County, the officer wracked his brain 
			 trying to figure out how it could have occurred, considering that none of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team agents 
			 at the scene said they had fired any shots.</p>
			 <p>
			 "I never thought I did it, but there were times I was thinking, 
			 'I don't know. This doesn't make any sense,''' he said. "If that was going to be attributed to me and I had no 
			 recollection of it ... could I continue in this profession?''</p>
			 <p>
			 When he learned investigators had tracked all his 
			 shots and the magazine of his AR-15 rifle was missing five bullets, he said he told them: "The FBI has a big 
			 effing problem, and this is serious.''</p>
			 <p>
			 The testimony from "Officer 1" - the only identification of the SWAT 
			 officer used in court because of government concerns over militia threats - is crucial to the prosecution's 
			 case in the trial of an FBI agent at the scene that day. </p>
			 <p>
			 Agent W. Joseph Astarita is accused of lying about 
			 having fired two disputed shots at Finicum's truck as state police and the FBI moved to arrest leaders of armed 
			 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. One struck the roof and one missed entirely.</p>
			 <p>
			 Astarita's 
			 lawyers have argued that other people at the scene, and most likely Officer 1, could have fired the shots.</p> 
			 <p>
			 Officer 
			 1 said he knew he hadn't fired the shots in question because investigators found only 24 rounds remaining in the 
			 magazine of his AR-15 rifle, which he said he loaded with 29 rounds. </p>
			 <p>
			 He had fired three times as Finicum's truck 
			 was speeding toward a roadblock set up on U.S. 395 as the refuge leaders left the bird sanctuary. They each 
			 struck the front of the truck. He then fired two times and struck Finicum's back after Finicum had walked away 
			 from his truck and reached into his jacket, according to investigators. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 1, now a captain who has worked 
			 for the state police for 20 years, was the lieutenant and commander of the agency's SWAT team at the time of 
			 Finicum's shooting. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 2, the second state police officer who shot Finicum that day, also testified - the 
			 first time either of them have publicly spoken about their roles in what happened. He fired once, his bullet also 
			 hitting Finicum in the back. He's now a sergeant with the tactical team, having worked 21 years with the agency.</p>
			 <p>
			 Their superiors worried from the outset that they would face threats, so much so that the night of the shooting 
			 they directed investigators to take photos of each officer with a paper bag concealing their faces when 
			 documenting their clothing and equipment. </p>
			 <p>
			 Prosecutors sought to portray the state police officers who fired their 
			 rifles that day as having acted according to state police policy while the FBI agents skirted standard protocol.</p>
			 <p>
			 The two state police officers said they immediately alerted supervisors that they had fired and surrendered their 
			 rifles and ammunition. </p>
			 <p>
			 In contrast, prosecutors showed that FBI agents were seen on aerial video scouring the 
			 scene for items and ducking under trucks after the shooting. The FBI agents also failed to ensure a shell casing 
			 spotted on the ground was marked as evidence and then in a highly unusual move, demanded they be interviewed as a 
			 group by detectives, prosecutors said. </p>
			 <p>
			 Defense lawyers have painted a much different portrait of state police, 
			 suggesting Officer 1, who was supposed to be in a command role that day, instead ran aggressively to confront 
			 Finicum in a risky maneuver without any cover causing a potential cross-fire situation with another state trooper.</p>
			 <p>
			 They pointed out that state police didn't immediately create a crime scene log to control who entered or exited 
			 the area and allowed other police vehicles to pass through. </p>
			 <p>
			 They suggested state police officers heightened the 
			 tension from the beginning by firing a less- lethal sponge bullet at Ryan Payne, the front seat passenger in 
			 Finicum's truck, who was about to surrender when authorities first stopped the two-car caravan of refuge leaders 
			 earlier on the highway. </p>
			 <p>
			 They also revealed that Officer 1 exchanged text messages about the shooting, witness 
			 officers' statements and evidence with state SWAT officer Joey Pollard, who witnessed the shooting, and their 
			 boss, Travis Hampton, now state police superintendent. The exchanges came before his interview, held five days 
			 after the shooting. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 2 testified that he was riding in a state police vehicle 
			 with two other officers at the initial stop. He said trooper Bob Olson fired a 40 mm sponge bullet at Payne and 
			 struck him in the hand when Payne hesitated in getting out of Finicum's truck as he tried to surrender. </p>
			 <p>
			 When it 
			 became clear Finicum and his other passengers weren't getting out, state police planned to have Olson fire a gas 
			 round through the open right passenger window. But Finicum drove off before that could happen, Officer 2 testified.</p>
			 <p>
			 State police followed at more than 70 mph to catch up to his truck, and Officer 2 radioed ahead to Officer 1, who 
			 was at the roadblock about a mile north. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 2 said he relayed to Officer 1 by radio that Finicum had yelled 
			 that he wasn't going to surrender and that Fincum was urging police to shoot him.</p>
			 <p>
			 Though Officer 1 said he was 
			 supposed to be in a command role at the roadblock, he said he shot at Finicum's truck as it sped toward the 
			 roadblock, his left foot in the snow on the east side of U.S. 395, and his right foot resting on the back of an 
			 FBI truck that was parked in a V formation in the highway. </p>
			 <p>
			 He said didn't think Finicum could avoid smashing 
			 into the roadblock even if he hit his brakes, but he fired "in an attempt to get that truck to apply the brakes'' 
			 or to have it veer off the side of the road. On cross-examination, Officer 1 said he couldn't see into the truck but
			 knew a driver and passengers were inside.</p>
			 <p>
			 After Finicum's truck crashed into a snowbank on the west side of the 
			 road, Officer 1 said he moved to the west side of the road to try to rescue an FBI agent who he thought had been 
			 run over. FBI agent John Neitert popped out of the snow behind Finicum's right rear tire. </p>
			 <p>
			 Focused on Neitert, 
			 Officer 1 said he recalled "being startled by loud noises to my right.'' </p>
			 <p>
			 Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Maloney 
			 asked if Officer 1 fired his rifle at any time as he moved from one side of the road to the other. "No I did not
			 ,'' he said. </p>
			 <p>
			 Defense lawyers pointed out that Officer 1 never reported being startled by a loud noise in his 
			 initial interviews with investigators and didn't share that information with prosecutors until more than two years 
			 after the shooting. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 1 said it wasn't an important fact relating to his shooting. Officer 1 said he moved 
			 around to the rear passenger side of a dark-colored FBI truck positioned on the west side of the roadblock's V 
			 formation and heard state SWAT officer Joey Pollard yelling commands to Finicum who had stepped away from the truck.
			 Pollard was standing in the tree line on the west side of the highway. </p>
			 <p>
			 As Finicum walked south away from his truck, 
			 Officer 1 said he walked into the snow to provide cover for Pollard, who transitioned from a handgun to a Taser, 
			 and to contain Finicum, making sure he didn't walk off from the scene. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 1 said he saw Finicum put his 
			 hands toward the center of his body. He then saw Finicum turn away from him toward Pollard and, in a "sweeping 
			 motion,'' reach with his right hand into his jacket, where Officer 1 believed Finicum kept a gun in a shoulder 
			 harness. </p>
			 <p>
			 "I felt at that moment I had to use lethal force'' to protect Pollard and himself, he said. </p>
			 <p>
			 Prosecutors 
			 had Officer 1 step off the witness stand and demonstrate for jurors how he typically loads his rifle magazine. 
			 Without counting each .223-caliber bullet, Officer 1 filled the magazine and removed one bullet and then emptied 
			 the clip, counting 29 bullets that he had loaded.</p>
			 <p>
			 On cross-examination, defense lawyers introduced a state police 
			 forensic report that found Officer's 1 rifle and magazine had a 31-bullet capacity, suggesting Officer 1 could have 
			 loaded more than 29 rounds in his magazine the day Finicum was shot. The rifle was left in the back seat of his 
			 unlocked truck after the shooting. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 2, who had driven with troopers following Finicum's truck to the roadblock, 
			 said when he arrived he saw Finicum outside of the truck. He said he saw Finicum's hands initially in the air but then 
			 he saw him reach with his right hand across his body to the left interior of his jacket. </p>
			 <p>
			 "I believe he was attempting 
			 to grab a firearm,''  Officer 2 testified. "I saw FInicum turn and look at Pollard and saw him reach into his jacket 
			 pocket two times.'' If he did it again, Officer 2 decided, he'd have to fire. Officer 2 stepped around the front of 
			 their truck, removed the safety on his A-10 rifle. He watched as Finicum turned his back slightly to him and reached 
			 into his jacket again, Officer 2 said.</p>
			 <p>
			 "At that point, I fired...as I prepared to squeeze the trigger, I heard one 
			 shot just prior to me,'' Officer 2 said. He surmised it came from Officer 1, who was to his right. </p>
			 <p>
			 Officer 2 fired once, 
			 and Officer 1 fired twice.</p>
			 <p>
			 Pollard, a 23-year state police veteran and 21-year member of the SWAT team, also testified Monday. 
			 He rode to the roadblock with Astarita and ran to the west snowbank to avoid Finicum's truck, he said. </p>
			 <p>
			 When Finicum 
			 stepped out of his truck, Pollard said he repeatedly ordered Finicum to get down on the ground, first holding a .
			 40-caliber handgun in his right hand. Pollard said he locked eyes with Astarita, concerned about a potential 
			 cross-fire situation, as Finicum started moving away from his truck.</p>
			 <p>
			 But in cross-examination, defense lawyers 
			 pointed to Pollard's October 2016 statement to investigators, when he said he made direct eye contact with Astarita 
			 at the moment Finicum got out of his truck. </p>
			 <p>
			 Defense lawyer David Angeli asked, "You didn't see anything to suggest that 
			 a shot had come from agent Astarita?'' </p>
			 <p>
			 "No, I did not,'' Pollard said. </p>
			 <p>
			 Prosecutor Gary Sussman followed up, asking if 
			 that was because Pollard's focus was elsewhere. Pollard said he was looking at Finicum's hands when Finicum stepped out 
			 of the truck and heard a "loud bang.'' </p>
			 <p>
			 After the shooting, Pollard drove Officer 1 from Burns to the Deschutes County 
			 Sheriff's Office in Bend. Deschutes County was tasked with leading the investigation of the shooting. After Officer 1 
			 and Officer 2 turned in their gear and were photographed, Pollard drove each officer home. </p>
			 <p>
			 In the days that followed, 
			 testimony Monday revealed Pollard exchanged multiple text messages with Officer 1 and instructed Officer 1 on Feb. 1 
			 about the bullet hole that forensic investigators found in the roof of Finicum's truck.
