								I was first introduced to tennis at four years old by my Mom. She would have us hit tennis balls with a racket at a "<a href="https://www.bing.com/

								She had just recieved a tennis coaching job over at Lebanon High School and was determined to get us involved. For the next few years my sister and 
								I began to use the courts weekly. Once new damage was done to the court, we noted it instantly. The fun of the day was walking to the nearby Seven 
								Eleven to get Slerpies and walking back.

								Once school was over my mother started up the Summer Tennis program. It was an oppertunity for the young who 
								couldn't afford professional lessions to learn. Eventually my sister became one of the assistant coaches for the middle schoolers, then I when I 
								turned Eleven. I didn't start teaching the high schoolers until my freshman year.

								We began to improve, soon being able to hit with the albany tennis club, where my first official 
								tourniment commenced. I was then beginning to play with the high school students and finally was a freshmen. I was the only new varsity player 
								other than the fourth ranked singles player. The first match was at South Albany, seen below, and was a great win for the Warriors! I once played 
								at state after a year injury, but before that I had the hardest match in my life with the 5th seated at districts. This match was two sets long, 
								took over four hours, and was close at 6-4, 7-5. After the match my mother and I were crying from the excitment of me getting to go to state.

								The only role model I had in tennis was Roger Federer. He was not only number one in tennis ranks world wide for some time, but he was one of 
								the least tempered, and kind hearted tennis players on the court. The only "fan item" I had was a racket bag with his signature. Mom would 
								always turn on more tennis when we got home and I would always root for The Babe of tennis.
