		<span style="margin-left:4em"> Musical Theater was when I was back in High school. I was a performer in two plays, a flower in "Alice of Wonderland", and Dorothy Gale in "Wizard of OZ".
		It was one of the best group efforts I have ever participated in and will always hold a place in my heart. Our performance can be viewed here:

		<font size="3"><br>
		<span style="margin-left:4em"> I only started skating a few years ago and have loved doing it! It's scary of course, and I have fallen repeatedly, but it's still fun just the same.
		Since last year though, I have started to slow down. While the whole family was skating on my birthday, my mother fell and broke her wrist, making my dad
		cautious of the sport. </span></br></font>

		<font size="3"><br><span style="margin-left:4em"> As my mom would put it "It's for the exercise!"......Yeah exercise. I have been playing tennis since I was four and have even
		gone to state my junior year. It was a big deal since I was the only one in my district who wasn't from Corvallis. The year before state I dislocated my shoulder while hitting an overhead.
		Since then I have retired from the courts and only play every now and then.</span></br></font>

		<font size="3"><br><span style="margin-left:4em"> Before High school I only sketched outlines of characters and flowers, but my first Computer Science teacher, Mr. Helland, taught me almost
		everything important to use a program called Blender. I then began to create pictures and videos using objects and physics. Mr. Helland than introduced me to another program called Unity, where I
		first learned to program in C#. About three months later I started to program in Java for the first time and fell in love with creating art with GUI.</span></br></font>
